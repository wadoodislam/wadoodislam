# 🧑‍💻 About Me  

I build intelligent systems that see, understand, and react to the world. My work blends **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **large-scale ML engineering** to solve high-impact real-world problems. 

I enjoy taking ideas from research and turning them into robust pipelines that run on real hardware, real users, and real constraints.

🧩 Seven years of hands-on engineering\
📷 Experience across 2D, 3D, temporal and multimodal ML\
🎓 Research background from Computer Vision and Graphics Lab (CVGL)\
🔍 Strong focus on reproducibility and clean engineering\
🌍 Collaborations with WWF and IWMB on wildlife conservation\
🐌 I support [slow science](http://slow-science.org/)
